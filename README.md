# Pathfinder

The program defined in main.py implements a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest possible path between the starting point ($) and the ending point (F).

There can in fact be an arbitary number of food points (F) - the algorithm will simply find the closest one.

If you want to change the maze to search through, simply swap out the array (named `maze`) defined in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
